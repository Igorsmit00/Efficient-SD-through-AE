* 'ExperimentCode.ipynb' contains code used for performing the experiment.
* 'dataImporter.py' provides a data import function which is used to load the datasets used in the paper.
* 'autoEncoder.py' provides a function to perform dimension reduction using an auto-encoder.
* 'beamSearch.ipynb' and 'adjPysubgroup' contain the code used to run the subgroup discovery algorithms.
* 'qualityMeasures.py' provides functions to evaluate the subgroups generated by the subgroup discovery algorithms.
* 'utilityFunctions.py' provides a function to perform normalization.
